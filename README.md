Plot: In 202X, a Nuclear War destroyed all of earth's civilization. 
The earth became a barren wasteland as the seas dried up and the ground became sandy.
Yet, humanity still thrives on. After the defeat of the Ninjutsu King, the peacemaking fighters, 
the Masubi Clan, have disbanded. Now only myth of legends tol by local villagers, evil still lurks
on the vulnerable villagers. New violent gangs and warlords began to rule the desert wasteland with
an iron fist. As the prayers of the innocents are called for a savior, the Heavens have found one 
surviving member of the legendary Masubi Clan. Using her yo-yo embeddeed with her clan emblem, Rin 
travels across the wasteland to find any surviving members and reunite them again as the once
peacemaking fighters, the Masubi Clan. Her training of Ninjutsu with a Yo-Yo will be put to the test 
as she faces the evil of the wasteland.
